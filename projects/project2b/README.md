# Project 2b: HOFs on trees & Database design
Due: March 12th 11:59 PM (Late: March 13th 11:59 PM)

Points: 40% public, 30% semipublic, 30% secret

**This is an individual assignment. You must work on this project alone.**

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to increase your familiarity with programming in OCaml and give you more practice with higher order functions and user-defined types. You will write a number of small functions that will use higher order functions operating over a tree structure, and then you will implement a program that simulates a database.

### Ground Rules
In addition to your own code, you may use library functions found in the [`Stdlib` module](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Stdlib.html) and the `List` module. You **may not** (under threat of a grading penalty) use any other s
